# Repository for various ros utils 

Currently contains `bags` folder where's jupyter notebook which has certain plotting methods. 
Idea is to further develop plotting methods for papers and stuff like that. Currently utilizing
following python packages: 
 * [bagpy](https://jmscslgroup.github.io/bagpy/installation.html) 
 * [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 
 * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 

It's advised to use `virtualenv` to avoid crashing your own python that's native. 

Instructions for creating and using `virtualenv` can be found [here](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/). 

Instructions for combining `jupyter notebook` and `virtualenv` can be found [here](https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/) 

Packages that could be used for using bags and plotting is presented [here]. 

There's also great introductory material for [Data logging and processing using rosbag](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/lec08-rosbag-ipython.pdf).
