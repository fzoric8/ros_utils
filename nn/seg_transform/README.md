# Segmenter neural network 

Use this notebook to try out segmenter neural network. 

We can create conda environment with following command: 
```
conda create --name tfKeras
```

You can activate conda environment with calling 
```
conda activate tfKeras
```

Install ipykernel: 
```
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel 
```

Import conda env in jupyter notebook 
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=tfKeras
```


Training fails due to missing memory on the GPU.
